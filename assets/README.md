# Assets

Place your media here:

- **hero-video/** – Hero video and optional poster: `hero-video.mp4`, `hero-poster.jpg`. Used at the top of the page; keep muted for autoplay.
- **other-videos/** – Videos for the “Other Videos” section. In `index.html` they are referenced as `video-1.mp4`, `video-2.mp4`, `video-3.mp4`. Add or rename files to match, or add more `<video>` tags in the Other Videos section and point `src` to your filenames (e.g. `assets/other-videos/my-clip.mp4`).

Section photos can live here too (e.g. `getting-ready-1.jpg`) and be referenced from `index.html`.
